  "comment": "The most beautiful visual spectacle ever created by Denis Villeneuve. A splendid narrative is little hurt by slow pace but is still worth watching. Dune is feature adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. It covers only half of it and takes 150 minutes for it which makes it often boring and it's little complicated too for mass lovers. But the same loss is recovered by the spectacular visuals which shows us an unimaginable future world. Set mostly in desert, the film has almost every single property looking new in sci-fi genre, and that fictional imagination of the visuals deserves credit for thinking out of the box. Not just that but the cinematic experience is excellent too. Look at the background music and how turns a simple scene look thrilling almost every single time. Dune has a big cast so it's unfair to name just few names here but yes everyone does their best with the characters they are portraying. If that's not enough then watch out for the costume designing of every character followed by brilliant VFX work and innovative action sequences. The action is less and not hard-core in that sense because as we know the film isn't a superhero flick. Yet, it fetches your attention with that ideation about the results of the action scenes. One has to think what would happen rather than thinking what's happening. That's some fun you know. However, i won't deny the fact that Dune is terribly slow in the first half with no proper conclusions about setting the plot. Thankfully, the second half comes as an improvement and even though we don't get to see a full stop at the end, it leaves us excited for the part two. Overall, another Worth Watching Villeneuve flick but please don't overhype it as if it is too great and Nothing like we haven't seen yet."
